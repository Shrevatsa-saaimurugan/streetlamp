Title: Ambient Intelligence for Urban Lighting: Street Light Sensor Calibration

Description:
Step into the realm of smart urban lighting with our innovative Street Light Sensor Calibration code. Designed to enhance the functionality of street lights, this Arduino-based solution offers a glimpse into the future of intelligent city illumination.

Key Features:

1. **Analog Sensor Integration:** Seamlessly connect analog sensors to our Street Light Calibration code. Whether it's light intensity, environmental data, or other sensor inputs, this code empowers street lights to respond dynamically to their surroundings.

2. **Real-time Data Mapping:** The code reads analog values from the connected sensor, mapping them to a user-defined range. This real-time data mapping ensures that the street lights adjust their illumination levels based on the specific sensor input, providing optimal lighting conditions at all times.

3. **Adaptive Brightness:** By utilizing the `map` function, our code intelligently scales sensor readings (ranging from 0 to 1023) to a more practical range, typically 0 to 100. This feature allows for adaptive brightness levels, responding to changes in environmental conditions and optimizing energy consumption.

4. **Serial Monitoring:** Gain insights into the system's performance through the Serial Monitor. The code regularly prints calibrated sensor values, enabling real-time observation and analysis of the street light's responsiveness to its surroundings.

5. **Configurable Delay:** Customize the delay period according to your preferences. The provided one-second delay allows for steady and informative updates in the Serial Monitor, but the code is flexible enough to accommodate different timing requirements.

This Street Light Sensor Calibration code paves the way for intelligent, energy-efficient urban lighting. Imagine streets that respond to variations in natural light, pedestrian activity, or traffic density, ensuring a safer and more welcoming city environment. Embrace the future of ambient intelligence with our Street Light Sensor Calibration code â€” illuminating urban spaces with efficiency, adaptability, and a touch of technological sophistication.
